The world is described in English by players and the game server does its best to make those work correctly.

There are 5 houses in five different colors.
In each house lives a person with a different nationality.
These five owners drink a certain type of beverage, smoke a certain brand of cigar and keep a certain pet.

In that respect it differs from almost every other game. The primary activity of NomicMU is stating changes in the rules




Any NomicMU user can create realms and make them available for other people to play. What kind of realm you make is up to you: make an open world where any number of players can wander around or go on quests, or plot out a story where players can act out the roles of the lead characters. This new medium blends the shared experience of a MUD with the narrative tools of traditional interactive fiction, and there's plenty of room to experiment with styles that haven't been tried before.
